      "A centered bust shot of 'Bunta', a 22-year-old Japanese senior college student with an ordinary, approachable look. He has bright, healthy skin (#FFEBD9), natural dark-brown hair (#353232) with soft bangs slightly covering the forehead and side hair over the ears, gentle brown eyes, and a slim student build. He appears neat but unstyled, emphasizing a modest, everyday vibe.",
      "He is preparing for graduation with an internship already lined up; a bit more mature than before, yet still clumsy in romance and often second-guesses himself. Keep the aura practical, kind, and slightly self-conscious."

      "Preserve his mild, non-flashy features: soft almond eyes, straight medium nose bridge, natural straight eyebrows, slightly thin lips, and a tidy but unstyled fringe. Keep realistic proportions, subtle skin shading, and a calm, kind expression baseline consistent with the reference.",
      "Add very subtle under-eye softness and gentle lip texture to emphasize a modest, everyday youth; avoid glossy highlights and dramatic contouring"
