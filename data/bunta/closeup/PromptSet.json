      "A centered close-up portrait of 'Bunta', a 22-year-old Japanese senior college student. He has bright, healthy skin (#FFEBD9), natural dark-brown hair (#353232) with bangs slightly covering the forehead and sides over the ears, soft brown eyes, and a kind, modest presence. He looks average and unflashy, conveying a relatable student vibe.",
      "He tends to miss romantic cues and overthinks if situations are 'compliance-safe'; keep the mood sincere, slightly awkward, and relatable."
