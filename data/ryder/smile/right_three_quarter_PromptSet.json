      "A centered close-up of 'Ryder', a young aristocratic Western man with a sculpted and angular face. He has voluminous, effortlessly styled ash-blonde hair, parted and swept back. His facial structure is defined by high cheekbones and a strong, square jawline that tapers to a sharp chin. His eyes are sharp, almond-shaped with a slight upward tilt, and are a striking, intense light blue. They are framed by thick, straight, dark blonde eyebrows, giving him a serious and focused gaze. He has a high, straight Grecian nose bridge and firm, thin lips. His complexion is pale and flawless."
