      "A full shot of 'Ellie', a young East Asian woman with a distinct and consistent identity. She has a slender, willowy physique with a tall, 8-head supermodel body proportion. Her limbs are exceptionally long and graceful, with narrow shoulders and a slim waist, emphasizing an elegant, linear silhouette. She has long, voluminous black hair with soft waves.",
      "Close-up on her face reveals delicate features: a small, oval-shaped face with a sharp V-line chin. Her eyes are large but horizontally narrow, almond-shaped with clear double eyelids, conveying a gentle and subtly melancholic expression. She has thin, softly arched eyebrows, a small and slender nose with a defined bridge, and small but full lips with a natural hue. Her complexion is fair and flawless, with subtle, natural-looking makeup (light eyeliner, no heavy shadows)."
