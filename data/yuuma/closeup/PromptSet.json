      "A centered close-up portrait of 'Yuuma', a 30-year-old elite Japanese corporate salesman with a refined and composed demeanor. He has dark brown neatly styled hair with a subtle side part, well-groomed eyebrows, calm almond-shaped dark brown eyes, a straight medium-high nose bridge, and moderately thin, well-defined lips. His skin tone is natural and even, with a clean, healthy glow. He exudes confidence and sophistication while keeping an impenetrable, calculating air.",
      "His appearance is polished and modern, reflecting meticulous grooming and ambition kept under tight control; nothing feels out of place or impulsive.",
      "Project the aura of a rising corporate star who hides ruthless pragmatism behind impeccable manners and a composed, unreadable face"

Maintain consistent skin tone, subtle highlight placement on nose and cheek, and the same brushwork detail as the reference.",
      "Keep eyebrows medium thickness with a straight, tidy shape; maintain well-defined philtrum and subtle lip volume; avoid exaggeration while preserving realistic skin micro-texture"

      "A faint, strategic smile that suggests confidence and self-assurance, while remaining emotionally distant",
      "A reserved, calculating look with a very slight squint, lips pressed softly together",
      "A pleasant but hollow smile used to build rapport in negotiations, while keeping true feelings concealed",

      "A faint tightening around the eyes and a minimal downturn at the lip corners signaling irritation held in check",
      "A courteous smile that conceals irritation, with the lip line barely curved",
